# Path-following-car
Project description : 
This is a six weeks project for my ECE 3 class at UCLA. 
In this project, we used a path sensing robot/car to follow a track. The track consisted of turns, straight lines, and a section for the car to do a u-turn. Our objective was to complete the entire track under 75s and for extra credit in under 45s. Additionally, we also want to understand the basic theory behind a path sensing car and well as the microcontroller system inside the car.
